GR(1)                       General Commands Manual                      GR(1)

NAME
     gr â€“ search for pattern in files

SYNOPSIS
     gr [-cwgni] pattern [file...]

DESCRIPTION
     gr is a pattern searching program in spirit similar to grep, but
     different in syntax and options.  gr is simpler, and focuses on fast
     workflow, not completeness in features.

     If no file is given all files in the current directory are searched,
     unless -i is specified.

   syntax
     Characters prefixed with '\' are treated literarly.  Alphabetical
     characters are matched case-sensitively, unless -c is set. following is a
     list of special characters:

           [  beginning of line

           ]  end of line

           ?  any character

           %  any word characters

           ~  any non word characters

     Other characters have no special meaning.

OPTIONS
     -c      caseless matching.

     -n      print file and line number.

     -w      show warnings.

     -g      print with color

     -i      read from stdin.

ENVIRONMENT
     FILECOLOR  determines a program for printing filenames when -g and -n are
                used.

SEE ALSO
